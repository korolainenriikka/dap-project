Notable is in any case that there are quite substantial differences in probabilities, up to 0.3, but the absolute probaility values never seem to exceed 0.4, so the nucleotide frequencies remain quite even (for example there is no longer context containing only one nucleotide). The solution that first initializes pseudo probabilities and then replaces them is at first sight a little confusing and has some magic numbers such as the +4 to the context lenght, but I am unsure if there exists a more readable solution for the problem."
